Locate the Apache httpd.conf file. This is the webserver's main configuration file and it is likely to be in a directory named "conf"

Include the following line in the config file ...
{{{
LoadModule helloworld modules/mod_HelloWorld.so
}}}

Where in the above ...
  * helloworld is the module name. It is equal to the value of the ModuleName constant you will find in mod_HelloWorld.dpr .
  * modules is the name of the directory that you put your so file. If you put it somewhere different, change accordingly.
  * mod_HelloWorld.so is the name of the output binary produced by compiling mod_HelloWorld.dpr . If you project has a different name, change accordingly.

Now also in the configuration file, after LoadModule, add the following configs ...

{{{
<IfModule helloworld>
  <Location "/hello">
    SetHandler mod_helloworld-handler
  </Location>
</IfModule>

<IfModule helloworld>
  pascali-setconfigroot banana
</IfModule>
}}}
